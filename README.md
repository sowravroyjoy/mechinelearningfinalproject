**Used Phones & Tablets Pricing Data Analysis**<br>

**Motivation and idea** <br>
As we all know, for current global inflation, the price of every essential product is increasing. Smartphones and tablets are also not protected from this. Their price is also bumped up mercilessly after the pandemic. That's why many general customers whose budget is not tight but wish to buy a decent phone or tablet for themselves as per their requirement, are leaning towards some kind of used and refurbished devices. Apart from the extensive price, to prevent global warming, using used and refurbished devices is a reasonable step as it will help to reduce carbon footprint. Due to these reasons, the market for used and refurbished devices has grown remarkably in the past few years. However, there is still confusion about the price of a refurbished device. There are many factors on which the price depends such as when it was released, how many days it was used, brand, OS, RAM, internal memory, battery size, and others. So, to get some idea about the pricing of this kind of device, I will analyze a dataset, apply Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithms, and probably will get a decent model as per requirement.

**Methodology**<br>
The project will be based on a dataset of Used Phones & Tablets Pricing Dataset on Kaggle, analyzed using the Python programming language. The project is an individual effort of Sowrav Roy Joy 100878102 and will be submitted at the end of Winter Term 2023, with delivery in the form of a project report.
